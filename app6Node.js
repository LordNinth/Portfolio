//1: Node is implementation of Js outside of browser
//Usecase
//i) It is used for creating web server. writing server side logic for FS applications
//without node, we can write code in the browser that can send request to server. We can send request to API with AJAX and do something with browser.
// But what if I want to build my own APi and I want to work with DB. Build full application. Node enables us to overcome this.

//ii) Build native applications such as Vs studio / slack 

//iii) Build games e.g crossCode

// node repl: read evaluate print and loop
//use to debug, play around with new tool/feature we install. We can also write JS. Think of it like: Node equivalent of JS console in chrome
//in node. Global is equivalent to Browser Window. It contains all the functions. Inside node, it is the top level bubble
//In node, we dont have any of the browser functions DOM API. But we have other built in modules which help us interact with files and OS.
